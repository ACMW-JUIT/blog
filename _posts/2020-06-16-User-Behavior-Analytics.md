This maybe a very big term for starters but the crowd's rage compels you to know more about it.

UBA (User Behaviour Analytics) is simply a tech tool which helps you predict what's coming with a degree of certainty by analysing relevant data and using monitoring systems' logs.
UBA uses BIG DATA and ML algorithms,working on the calculation of possible threats using trends and patterns spotted.
Talking about the working,UBA revolves around Events. Events are activities which a product allows. 
Using event data lik logging on, reviews,duration of use etc. ,it finds out a way to understand a user's response and interest. It brings out the importance of monitoring end-user behaviour and reinforces an enterprise's security framework and avoiding breaches.

Analyst firm Gartner brought up this concept as  a cybersecurity tool published as UEBA(User entity behaviour analytics) which has same capabilities as traditional UBA but it also combines user activity with activity on devices, application, services and data.
Aruba,Forcepoint,Dtex and Exabeam are leading solution providers in the market and are connecting more industries with the help of this technology to overcome any malicious attack and give real-time performance.There is no stopping as the tech world has always some new handy picks for all. Sentiment-based analytics to understand employee morale and anti data  ex- filteration  programs are the upcoming breakers thus further unlocking new opportunities in this field.

UBA justifies and stands by the vitality of analysis and how data without context is of no use.
